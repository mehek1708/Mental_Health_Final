# ***Understanding Mental Health Inequality on a Global Scale***

### **Introduction**
Mental health plays a vital role in overall well-being of a person, and yet, mental healthcare remains one of the most unequally distributed health services across the world. While some countries have robust mental health policies and specialist availability, others face gaps in care, funding, and infrastructure. These disparities are often shaped by deeper structural and socioeconomic differences.

This project aims to analyze global mental health indicators using real-world, country-level datasets. We apply different machine learning techniques/models to uncover hidden patterns and build predictive models that help us better understand access to mental healthcare across nations.

## Visual Analysis

### Death Rates by Substance Use
- **Metric:** Global average death rates per substance type  
- **Visuals:** Radar charts grouped by age  
- **Insight:** Highest death rates occur in middle-age and elderly groups for drug-related causes.

### Gender-wise Drug Use Comparison
- **Metric:** Drug use rate by gender and substance  
- **Visuals:** Radar plots  
- **Insight:** Male rates generally higher, but gap varies by substance.

### Age Group Disorder Prevalence
- **Metric:** Global average disorder rates by age  
- **Visuals:** Line plots and bar charts  
- **Insight:** Disorders like anxiety and depression peak in younger and mid-age groups.

## Summary

The project successfully demonstrated that machine learning is a powerful tool for both uncovering complex global patterns and disparities in mental health burdens and for accurately predicting the existence of critical access-related infrastructure. This provides valuable insights for understanding the global mental health landscape and potentially informing policy and resource allocation.
