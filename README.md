# ***Understanding Mental Health Inequality on a Global Scale***

### **Introduction**
Mental health plays a vital role in overall well-being of a person, and yet, mental healthcare remains one of the most unequally distributed health services across the world. While some countries have robust mental health policies and specialist availability, others face gaps in care, funding, and infrastructure. These disparities are often shaped by deeper structural and socioeconomic differences.

This project aims to analyze global mental health indicators using real-world, country-level datasets. We apply different machine learning techniques/models to uncover hidden patterns and build predictive models that help us better understand access to mental healthcare across nations.
